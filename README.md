# Windows-Optimization-Bat-file
A bat file optimization script that I made with new optimizations from chat gpt

This script does the following:

Deletes temporary files from the system, including the Windows temp folder and Prefetch folder to free up disk space.

Clears the Pagefile cache to improve performance.

Adjusts Virtual Memory to allocate more space for pagefile.sys.

Adjusts Power Settings to maximize performance.

Disables Windows visual effects to reduce resource usage.

Adjusts Processor Scheduling to prioritize background services over applications.

Adjusts Network Settings to optimize network performance.

Adjusts Internet Explorer settings to allow more concurrent connections to a server.

Adjusts Disk Caching settings to disable Superfetch and Prefetch.

Adjusts File System settings to disable the last access timestamp feature and optimize NTFS memory usage

Please note that running this script may take some time to complete, depending on the size of your hard drive and the amount of data stored on it. Additionally, it's always recommended to backup your data before making any changes to your system.
